## About:


Personal Health Buddy is a mobile app that tracks information about the users's health and provides useful recommendations based on it. It collects data in three categories - sleep, nutrition, and wellness - and calculates a score based on how well the user did for that area. It also calculates an overall score as well as a relevant suggestion based on which category the user scored least. Additional features include viewing logs from previous days and an account/login system.

This uses React Native as the front end, which retrieves user's info from a MySQL database hosted on an AWS instance. Python's FastAPI framework was used to create an API to make simplify the process of receiving and sending data.

This project was made for CS 125 at UCI with a team of 3 other students.
