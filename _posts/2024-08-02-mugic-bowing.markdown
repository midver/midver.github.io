## About

[MUGIC](https://www.mugicmotion.com/) is a small sensor which gathers and sends movement data. 

We worked on a standalone desktop app which connects to the MUGIC device and visualizes violin bowing movements. Movements are visualized by a moving line on a graph, where the x axis represents the roll and the y axis reprsents the yaw. Users can record and save their movements to a file, allowing it to be loaded in during a different session and compared to other movements.

This was made for INF 117 with a team of 4 other people.
